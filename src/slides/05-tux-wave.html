    I decided that if I was going to keep creating, I had to make something silly that made me smile.

    Tux wave was first created with an arduino microcontroller and then an esp32.  
    There are 16 by 16 leds.  The drawing was done in a program called piskel which generates c output for me.
    The c output can be used in the arduino ide to code animations with it.
    I decided to only use two moves to keep this as simple as possible.
    The case was 3d printed, the designs were used off of youtube. 

    People seemed to really connect with it. That motivated me to keep going.
