<h2>Patterns within encrypted images</h2>

<aside class="notes">
  So this is what gave me the idea of using the cat map with my leds.
  I could illustrate the process of image encryption with the map!
  
  A little bit about image encryption with Arnold Cat Map. 
  
  Benefits of using an HTA 
  * Area preserving 
  * Invertible, if you have a key you can get the image back
  * Chaotic, in particular it has mixing properties 
  
  Some of the cons are 
  * It only permutes the pixels 
  * Once you the which map is being used it easy to decrypt 
  
  
  **Bring out the pixel box to show** 
  
  **Click through unti it repeats.** 
  ** Ask them to guess the image! **

  **Turn on second 14 by 14 box**
