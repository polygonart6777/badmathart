<aside class="notes">
  In 2015 a colleague and I created a math and art class at Western
  Washington University. The course was created as an alternative to the typical
  lecture classroom. Each day, students would recieve about 5 to 15 minutes
  worth of instruction and the rest of the time would be spent on exploration.
. The topics for the course included origami, non-euclidean geometry,
  polyhedra, tilings, perspective and so much more.
  
  After creating the course, I pursed my PhD. My topic of choice was in
   quasicrystals and aperiodic tilings. I felt very lucky to be
  studying something where there were so many discoveries being made each year.


  During my PhD, and largely because of the inspiration of this program, I pursued 
  a career in the tech industry, to learn about the possibilities for math communication,
  in alternative spaces. 
  
  In developing the course and throughout my time as a
  PhD student, I did a lot of 3d printing, laser cutting, animations with
  Mathematica. Getting access to these tools was actually fairly involved and
  not so easy at the time. It was the community of makers that I was after,
  someone to chat about 3d printer options with, or help with laser cutting
  specs, free tools for designs. 
  
  
  More recently, I've been getting involved with
  my local Makerspace where I'm a volunteer. I've been focusing on 3d printing, 
  lasercutting and electronics.
