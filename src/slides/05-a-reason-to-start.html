   If I set out to make something that from the get go I know will be bad, it gives me a little bit of space to start.
   Finger painting analogy.
   Vulnerability in knowing that this is going to be bad but trying anyway.  
   The reason to try, is for the process of creative expression and communication.
   For me that is the most important aspect.  
   Being able to share mathematical ideas in various forms and to learn from those creative collaborations. 
   
   In this talk, I'm hoping to illustrate this process through an example.  
   How the pursuit of creating mathart and communicating mathematical ideas can be beneficial in whatever forms they make take.
   The answer for me lies in the pursuit.
