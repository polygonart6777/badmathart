<!-- Sketch of rauzy led wall here -->


<aside class="notes">

    For a recent project, what I wanted to do was create the Rauzy tiled but depicted in leds.
    I had this elaborate plan to showcase it at a local tech conference I was helping organize in my hometown.
    I was really inspired by a lot of folks from the conference who hat led hats or backbacks.


    So I thought, a led screen as a start. I chose a 16 by 16 led. 
    Instead of building up the tiling like in the previous images, 
    I wanted to start with a full tiling and then decompose the tiles.
    Issues I ran into
    * Working with 16 by 16 pixels is very constraining.  
     Fractals like a lot of room, they do not do well being constrained.
    * Lots of technology to work with, arduino, code, led connections, power, case for led, 3d printed, connect leds together.
    * Animation had to be illustrative, could not just be flashing the different steps.
    Became overwhelmed.
    Too many factors.
    I'm supposed to be doing this for fun, learning and sharing math ideas
    and instead this is causing anxiety, turmoil.
    I started to avoid working on it and went into some sort of freeze response.

    This was not a good way to live. 
    I really enjoy working on mathart and want to keep doing more of it.
    What would help me get back into iterations?
    For me what helps, is letting go of expectations and not taking myself so seriously.


    I decided, you know what, I'm going to create some bad mathart,
    but it has to be something that will make me smile.


    Elements
    * I kept the arduino
    * Kept the idea of flashing movement but scaled it down to just two moves.
    * Used the mascot for linux which is the tux penguin.
