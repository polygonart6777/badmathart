<h2>Discrete HTA </h2>
Let $A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$

<br />
<br />
Let N be a natural number. Define 
\[ g_A : \mathbb{Z}^2_N \to \mathbb{Z}^2_N \, \text{ as } \, g_A({[x]}_N)
= {[Ax}]_N \text{ with } x \text{ in } \mathbb{Z}^2 \]

    Since I was going to be working by a 16 by 16 set of leds,
    I thought, "Why not look into what happens for the Arnold Cat Map for the discrete case instead"
