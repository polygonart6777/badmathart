Is there a pattern to when the image will come back?

<style>
  .graph {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
  }
</style>

<div class="graph">
  <img width="1500px" src="/src/assets/period_graph2.png" alt="period-graph" />
</div>

<aside class="notes">
  Order them in a graph. Order them in a table. 
  First thing to notice is that the distribution of periods is pretty wild! Assuming square image.
</aside>
