<h2>Hyperbolic Toral Automorphisms</h2>
Let $A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$

<br />
$\lambda_1 = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$ and $\lambda_2 = \frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2}$

\[\text{Define } f_A : \mathbb{T}^2 \to \mathbb{T}^2 \, \text{ as } \, f_A([x])
= [Ax]\] Where $[x]$ is the equivalence class in $\mathbb{T}^2 =
\mathbb{R^2/Z^2}$.

  But wanted to add a bit of math.
  I promised you a definition of Hyperbolic Toral Automorphisms.
  My thesis dealt with Hyperbolic Toral Automorphisms, and thought it would be cool to use them within this piece.
  Note that the matrix entries are integers.
  One of the eigenvalues is greater than 1 while the other is less than one. 
  Stretches in one direction while it compresses in another.
