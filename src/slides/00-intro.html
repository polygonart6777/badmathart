    -------------TO DO-------------
    Thank you.
    
    A lot of artists I've talked to have objections to this.   
    I wanted to use 'silly' or 'ugly' but none of these words encompassed what I was trying to do. 
    I wanted a word that doesn't place emphasis on the outcome but the process instead. 

    Connection, convenience, creativity.
    Call to create, call to make things.

    I really like that people are actively thinking about how to communicate mathematics.
