<h1> Five Reasons to Create ''bad" mathart </h1>
<h4> Illustrating Mathematics Reunion and Expansion - ICERM 2025</h4>

    Thank you to conference organizers! And to work!
    
    A friend of mine who is an artist has some objections to this title.  
    I used to go to their studio and ask them if we could make some ugly art together.
    They didn't like it because they said "Dina we can just create art."
    But I can get pretty critical. So for me,  it is really helpful to put some of that criticism at bay, by saying I'm going to just create some bad  mathart.
    I wanted a word that places the emphasis on the process instead of the outome. 
    For me personally, I do it as a way to communicate between abstract ideas and the real world.
    It goes both ways for me. i.e Taking an abstract idea, making it real and then looking at what was made real and forming more abstract ideas.
    If you can relate to any of this, then that's amazing, but if not, you'll get to hear a different perspective.
