    Arduino and ESP32 - 
    Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software.
    An arduino board is a microcontroller that is programmable to control electronics such as leds, motors, sensors etc.
    An esp32 is a microcontroller similar to an arduino but it also has bluetooth and wifi capabilities.  It's also a lot cheaper.  
    An arduino UNO costs about $20 while an ESP32 costs about $5. 

    3d printer for the case - 
    * I used someone else's code
    * Bambu Lab A1, very easy to use
    * Filament is PETG-HF, PETG and is a little bit nicer to use than pla

    Arduino ide
    * C like 
    * Lots of libraries available include FASTLED
    * What else is interesting about the IDE?
    
    AI tools such as ChatGPT and Claude

    Images
    * Show code this is important in showing 'bad' mathart since a lot of people are scared to show their code.  
    But if you know you're creating bad mathart than you show off your messy code proudly.
    * Show addressible led
    * Show esp32 and arduino
    * Show bambu a1
